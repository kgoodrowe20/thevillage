\f0\fs24 \cf0 I believe I did a good job with this game. Though not every aspect is how I thought it would turn out, I think the game does a good job conveying the story I want it to.\
\
I got stuck when I was trying to make the game notify the player what direction the horde was coming from. The way I got unstuck was contacting Mrs. Kiang and getting her help. She gave me exactly what I needed and I was able to refine that aspect of my game.\
\
The first puzzle involves the large steel door in the first room. You can bypass this by simply going around, but you risk being attacked by the horde. To find the password, you must inspect the wires of a metal box in the room. This will give you a number that corresponds to the color of the wire. To learn what order the numbers go in, you can look at the terminal and see that it is in a rbg color scheme. That\'92s the order the numbers of the wires should be in.\
\
The second puzzle involves the fence blocking the mountain. To get past this fence you must find a way to cut it down. You can find an axe in the village to deal with this issue.\
\
The last puzzle involves figuring out what to do with the glowing screw you get from cutting the fence down, and what to do with the holy battery at the summit of the mountain. The screw can be used to power on Boltz, the npc, while the battery can be taken to the church to win the game.\
\
The main gameplay mechanic would be the roaming horde. I feel this gives the player some danger and urgency, making the game a more exhilarating experience. \
\
Brent tested my game. Him playing my game gave me a lot of insight into what doesn\'92t make sense in my game. As a player doesn\'92t know the bigger picture like I do, they would need more hints. I added more directional markers, as well as hints to what you should be doing in the game. Middle schoolers also played my game. After this I realized that a lot of my main game progression points were too hidden, so I made it so that the game holds the player\'92s hand more throughout.\
\
I tested Brent\'92s game. He still had some kinks to work out but it was still a solid game. The main feedback I gave was just to fix taking things that shouldn\'92t be able to be taken (a computer, for instance).\
\
I\'92m most proud of my ability to problem solve. I had a lot of bugs when making this game, but I think I did a good job of dealing with them. My game now runs smoothly and bug-free as far as I know.\
\
Something I would do differently next time is incorporate the NPC more. I made him a part of the puzzle but you don\'92t need him to beat the game. I feel that next time I would make it so that the NPC is an integral part of the gameplay.\
